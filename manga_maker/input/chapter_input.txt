The rain pounded against the neon-lit pavement of Neo-Tokyo. Kael pulled his collar up, shielding his cybernetic eye from the downpour. It had been three days since the incident at the Arasaka tower, and the heat was still on.

"They won't stop coming," he muttered to himself, the vibration of his voice barely audible over the drone of the city.

Suddenly, a shadow detached itself from the alleyway entrance. A figure, draped in a tattered cloak, stepped into the dim light of a flickering vending machine.

"Kael," the figure rasped. "You have something that belongs to us."

Kael smirked, his hand drifting towards the mono-wire concealed in his sleeve. "Come and take it."

The figure lunged, faster than any human, blades extending from its forearms. Kael sidestepped, the air crackling as the blades missed his throat by an inch.

"Too slow," Kael taunted. He unleashed the wire, a glowing blue filament that sliced through the rain.

The clash of steel and spark illuminated the alley. This was going to be a long night.
